# Workshop description

Join this crash-course into the exciting world of live coding music. No previous knowledge of programming required, only a desire to express yourself creatively! During this workshop you will learn to create electronic music with computercode and algorithms! For this we use the programming language Mercury. You will program the instructions and the computer will translate that to beats. You can adjust the code in real time while the music is playing and hear it change. Welcome to the world of Live Coding! At the end of the workshop you have been introduced to technologies used in electronic music production and you will have experienced what it means to use algorithms to compose music and sound.

# In-depth description of Mercury

Mercury is a minimal and human-readable language that focusses on quick expression in composing, performing and communicating live coded music. Mercury is a great environment to get introduced to the amazing worlds of live coding, creative coding, algorithmic composition, electronic music and of course the Algorave scene! In Mercury, all elements of the language are designed around making code more accessible and less obfuscating for the performer and the audience. This motivation stretches down to the coding style itself which uses clear descriptive names for functions and a clear syntax. Furthermore the environment runs in the browser so it is available to you at all times. Mercury provides the artist-programmer with an extensive library of algorithms to generate sequences, sounds and music.

<!-- - What is Mercury for and how is it different or similar to other livecoding languages? What is the concept and vision behind the language? -->

# Goals

## Starter Goals
- Learn to play a sample
- Change the timing of the played sound
- Make lists as rhythms and use probabilities
- Generate lists with functions

## Intermediate Goals
- Learn to play a synth
- Make lists as melodies and rhythms for the synth
- Generate lists of melodies and rhythms with functions

## Advanced Goals
- Combine functions to generate more complex melodic and rhythmical structures
- Add effects for sound designing
- Sequence parameters of effects and other functions
- Include visuals coded with Hydra
- Control synths with external devices via OSC
- Sequence other applications via MIDI output
